FEARSOME FOURSOMES WEBPAGE

This page utilizes on click toggling, randomized background colors and embedded background music. 

In order to change the background color each time the page is refreshed, we used the Math.random() method.

To enable each of the graphics on the page to switch between two images, we used jQuery's on click function. Try clicking on each image to find a hidden surprise!
