/*Halfway Hackathon

Congratulations! Today we are at the halfway point in our class. Let's celebrate with a hackathon! A hackathon is a great opportunity to work on a larger, real-world project, while reviewing and solidifying the core concepts that we've covered in the first half of the course.

Step 1: Make a Plan

Take a few minutes to brainstorm some project ideas. This could be related to your community site, a stand-alone project, or just a crazy mash-up site to help you practice different coding concepts
Review the Step 3: Coding section below to consider the different concepts that we hope to practice during this project.
In groups of four, hold a standup meeting to present your plan of what you'd like to accomplish, and potential stumbling blocks.
If someone mentions being concerned about a concept that you feel solid on, offer to be a resource for them if they have questions.
Step 2: Set up a GitHub repo

Open the Terminal and run:
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
Go to GitHub and sign in or sign up for an account
Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the new repository menu, upper-right
Follow the instructions presented in the new repository

Step 3: Coding

The following lists the core web development skills that you should feel comfortable using in your project thus far:

Use Markdown to create a README.md file introducing your project. Push to GitHub and see it rendered on your repository's main page
Create an HTML document using the following HTML tags:
html, head, title, body
header and paragraph tags
bold and italic tags
divs and spans
ordered and unordered lists
images and links
horizontal rule and line break
Use a style attribute on an HTML element, then a <style> tag in the head, then a <link> tag to a separate .css document to include CSS styles in your page. Try to use the following CSS properties at a minimum:
color, background-color, background-image
font-size, font-family
height, width, max-width
margin, padding, border, border-radius
Refactor your code to use classes and ids.
Use some complex CSS selectors such as descendent selectors
Use an iframe to embed videos or maps on your page
Use float and and position: fixed to position some elements
Create an HTML form incorporating various inputs (text, password, email, textarea, radio, checkbox, select menu, submit, etc)
Make your form live using Formspree
Use the Bootstrap grid system to lay out your page
Use some pre-written Bootstrap CSS classes on various elements of your page
Use alert, prompt, and console.log where appropriate
Set and retrieve values from JavaScript variables
Use document.querySelector in conjunction with textContent and innerHTML to retrieve and place content on the page
Use if, elseif and else to implement branching logic on the basis of comparing variables and values
Use logical and (&&), logical or (||), and the ternary operator
Use while loops to do work multiple times until a condition is met
Use the Math object and parseInt
Use jQuery to select existing HTML elements on the page
Use jQuery's .css(), .attr(), .text(), .html(), .append(), and .val() to both get and set values
Use some jQuery effects like .show(), .slideDown() and .fadeOut()
Stretch Goals

Use some of Bootstrap's JavaScript utilties
Try incorporating some jQuery Plug-ins
Step 4: Deploy & Promote

Deploy your code to Github Pages using your command line tools
Post a link on Slack so your classmates can enjoy your work
Send it to your friends and family members so they can be proud of you
Social media?
Step 5: Profit?
